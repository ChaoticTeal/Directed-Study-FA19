# Directed-Study-FA19

This is a narrative puzzle game in the vein of NES classics 
such as Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy.
The project will be created over the course of fifteen weeks
and rigorously documented, so the end result will be not only
a game, but a thorough report on the development journey.
