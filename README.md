# Directed-Study-FA19

Gratia is a narrative puzzle game in the vein of NES classics 
such as Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy.
The project was be created over the course of fifteen weeks
and rigorously documented, so the end result is not only
a game, but a thorough report on the development journey.

Gratia is now available for download at https://purpleninjalink.itch.io/gratia

The documentation for the project is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/PurpleNinjaLink/Directed-Study-FA19/wiki).
